          <h2>Theggo</h2>
          <p>Theggo is a product of Careinfo Solutions a tech-driven platform built to simplify the process of buying and selling software. With a marketplace-like approach, Theggo is tailored to meet the needs of tech professionals and business owners seeking digital solutions. During the initial research phase, I explored similar platforms like Blanxer to understand common patterns and user expectations in the software marketplace space. This informed the structure and flow of the platform while ensuring the final design remained original and aligned with Theggo’s brand goals.</p>

          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 days</p><br>
          <p><strong>My Role</strong><br> I was responsible for the complete design of Theggo starting from brand identity (logo) to UI/UX design for both desktop and mobile. Working closely with my mentor and client through feedback loops, I led the creative direction and handled everything from ideation to final handoff.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>My Contribution</strong><br>I led the UI/UX design of the entire website from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups. My responsibilities included:</p>
          <li>Designed Theggo’s brand logo, capturing its identity as a clean, modern, and tech-forward product</li>
          <li>Created UI layouts for key pages: Homepage, Pricing, and Blog</li>
          <li>Built the design from scratch after researching similar platforms like Blanxer establishing layout, structure, and user flow tailored to Theggo’s goals</li>
          <li>Ensured visual consistency by defining typography, colors, components, and iconography</li>
          <li>Delivered responsive designs that scale seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices</li>
          <li>Communicated design rationale with mentor and implemented client feedback into iterations</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Design Decision & Thought Process</strong><br> Theggo needed to stand out not just as another software store, but as a platform that feels reliable and forward-thinking. I started with logo exploration to capture a bold, tech-centered identity. The final mark reflects a clean, modern identity that aligns with the platform’s tech-focused nature and target audience.<br> UI decisions focused on minimalism, whitespace, and strong CTAs. On the homepage, key sections were organized to highlight the value of Theggo clearly and quickly. The Pricing page was structured to be scannable and informative, and the Blog layout was kept clean to improve content readability and SEO potential.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Responsive Experience</strong><br> Given the tech-savvy target audience, mobile responsiveness was critical. I optimized all sections for smaller screens balancing text, buttons, and visuals for fast scrolls and intuitive navigation. The mobile layout reflects the same structure as desktop while prioritizing usability and visual clarity.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Impact</strong><br> The final design helped define Theggo’s identity as a tech product blending both branding and interface into a cohesive experience. It’s intuitive, flexible, and ready to scale as the platform evolves. Personally, this project deepened my experience in brand building, user-focused UI/UX, and owning a full product from the ground up.</p>
