          <h2>Careinfo Solutions</h2>
          <p>Careinfo Solutions is an IT company providing services like mobile app development, web development, cybersecurity, digital marketing, and more.

          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 weeks</p><br>
          <p><strong>My Role</strong> As the UI/UX Designer, I led the complete redesign of Careinfo Solutions' official website from ideation to final UI. I worked independently under the guidance of a mentor, who provided feedback throughout the design process. My role included layout design, information structuring, component creation, and maintaining brand consistency across all pages and screen sizes.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>My Contribution</strong><br> I led the UI/UX design of the entire website from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups. My responsibilities included:</p>
          <li>Designing responsive layouts for desktop and mobile</li>
          <li>Designed five key pages: Homepage, Services, About Us, Products, and Blog</li>
          <li>Structuring content hierarchically for fast scanning and usability</li>
          <li>Creating intuitive sections like service categories, process flow, and contact forms</li>
          <li>Applying a consistent visual language through typography, icons, and color</li>
          <li>Enhancing accessibility and readability for both corporate and individual users</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Design Decision & Thought Process</strong><br> The company wanted a website that felt simple, professional, and aligned with their startup goals. I focused on clarity using clean layouts, consistent components, and balanced spacing. My design system followed Inter as the primary font, paired with soft neutrals and confident accent colors. Each section was built with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion of services and products. I iterated several times based on mentor feedback to ensure the user journey felt logical and engaging.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Responsive Experience</strong><br> Mobile responsiveness was built in from the start. I used a mobile-first mindset to create layouts that were easy to navigate, readable, and visually balanced. Each section was optimized for tap targets, collapsible elements, and short scroll distances to create a smooth on-the-go experience.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Impact</strong><br> The final design gave Careinfo Solutions a refreshed identity that confidently communicates who they are and what they offer. It helped establish their credibility as a modern IT company, made their services easier to explore, and set a solid foundation for future updates and digital growth. Personally, this project helped me gain real experience in design systems, feedback iteration, and seeing a full-scale product from start to finish.</p>
