          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 weeks</p><br>
          <p><strong>My Role</strong><br> I led the UI/UX design process from start to finish. Working closely with my mentor and directly with the client (a finance expert), I translated accounting requirements into user-friendly wireframes and high-fidelity designs. I also made design decisions around visual hierarchy, data visibility, and intuitive navigation based on real accounting workflows.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>My Contribution</strong><br> I led the UI/UX design of the entire website from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups. My responsibilities included:</p>
          <li>Designed all modules including Dashboard, Ledger, Bank Book, Trial Balance, Inventory, Sales & Purchase</li>
          <li>Mapped out the entire information architecture and layout system</li>
          <li>Created reusable components and tables for consistency across modules</li>
          <li>Developed intuitive navigation for multi-step workflows such as adding sales, issuing invoices, or tracking stock</li>
          <li>Focused on usability and visual balance, especially in data-heavy screens</li>
          <li>Ensured a clean and minimal interface to reduce user overwhelm and improve legibility</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Design Decision & Thought Process</strong><br> From the start, I wanted to design a tool that would feel familiar to accounting professionals yet modern enough for any digital workflow. I began by researching tools like FrappeBooks to understand successful patterns in finance UI. Since most users would spend long hours in the system, I chose a layout with clear separation of content, fixed left navigation, and strong data structure. The blue and gray theme was selected for its neutrality and professional tone, while components were kept modular for future scalability. Data tables were optimized for scannability, and action buttons were placed where users naturally expect them improving efficiency without clutter.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Desktop-Centered Experience</strong><br> This design was specifically created for desktop use, keeping in mind that accountants and business users primarily work on larger screens for detailed data entry and analysis. The layout prioritizes clarity and organization for desktop workflows, with sidebar navigation, wide data tables, and intuitive content grouping all aimed at improving focus and reducing user fatigue during long work sessions.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Impact</strong><br> This project helped transform complex accounting workflows into a streamlined and visually intuitive system. It bridged the gap between accounting logic and interface clarity. The design empowered the client to visualize key operations in one place improving task flow and decision-making. It also deepened my understanding of designing for data-heavy platforms, especially where accuracy, clarity, and user trust are non-negotiable.</p>
