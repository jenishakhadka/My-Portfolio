          <h2>TMC Cargo</h2>
          <p>TMC Express is a courier and cargo company offering global shipping, express delivery, and logistics services. The original website served its basic purpose, but the company aimed to modernize its visual identity and improve the overall user interface. I was tasked with redesigning the website to better reflect their professional image and provide users with a more intuitive and visually engaging experience while preserving the original layout structure.</p>

          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 days</p><br>
          <p><strong>My Role</strong><br> As a UI/UX Designer at Careinfo Solutions, I worked on redesigning TMC’s website for both desktop and mobile views. I handled the end-to-end visual refresh ensuring the updated design was aligned with the company’s goals of clarity, trust, and improved usability.</p><br>
          <p><strong>My Contribution</strong><br>I led the UI/UX design of the entire website from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups. My responsibilities included:</p>
          <li>Redesigned the Homepage, Services, Contact, Track, and Cost Calculator sections</li>
          <li>Maintained the overall layout structure to ensure continuity but introduced improved</li>
          <li>Focused on content clarity and accessibility while subtly modernizing components and CTAs</li>
          <li>Designed both desktop and mobile views to ensure the experience was consistent and responsive across devices</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Design Decision & Thought Process</strong><br> The goal was to modernize the look without losing the familiarity of the original structure. I retained the overall layout positions for key elements like the Cost Calculator but gave them a visual upgrade refining how information is grouped, improving contrast, and making components feel more current. Typography and spacing were adjusted for better readability, and color choices were made to create a cleaner, more trustworthy feel. I also made sure that the service cards and FAQ sections looked well-structured and consistent throughout the site.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Responsive Experience</strong><br> Since users may access TMC’s services while on the move, I paid close attention to the mobile experience. The layout adapts seamlessly to smaller screens, maintaining usability and aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. The calculator, cards, and CTA buttons were scaled and spaced for easy interaction on touch devices.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Impact</strong><br> The redesigned interface gave TMC Express a visually updated and professional appearance, improving its credibility and user experience. Though the site is not yet live, the design aligns with the brand's goals and is ready for future implementation. For me, this project strengthened my approach to subtle redesigns focusing not on drastic overhauls, but on smart improvements that elevate the user experience while respecting brand familiarity.</p>
