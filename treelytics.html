          <p><strong>My Role</strong> As a UI/UX Designer Intern at Treeleaf Technologies, I was responsible for designing key modules of the Treelytics platform, a complex data analytics tool. I independently handled the UI/UX for core features such as dashboard creation, data source configuration, and data visualization panels, Query Builder. My role involved translating technical requirements into clear, user-focused interfaces, while ensuring design consistency across the platform. I collaborated with lead developer and received feedback to align the design with business needs. While some dashboard pages were initially created by a previous intern, I refined and extended them to build a scalable, cohesive user experience. I also worked alongside a teammate who contributed to the alert and settings modules, as well as prototyping support.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>My Contribution</strong><br>I led the UI/UX design of the entire website from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups. My responsibilities included:</p>
          <li>Designed key pages such as:<br> Dashboard creation & view, Data Source configuration, Data Tables, Query Builder, Data Controls, and core layout for Add/Edit dashboards</li>
          <li>Created UI components including:<br> Progress cards, data modals, alert forms, sidebar panels, navigation tabs, and dropdowns</li>
          <li>Built a consistent design system using a 12-column grid, carefully applied color palette, and reusable layout elements</li>
          <li>Improved data visualization clarity with readable charts, user-focused panel structures, and collapsible sidebars</li>
          <li>Integrated accessibility and UX best practices into data-heavy screens</li>
          <li>Supported real-time functionality UI, such as streaming inputs, test connections, and live chart updates</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Design Decision & Thought Process</strong><br> Given the complexity of Treelytics, I prioritized clarity, consistency, and customization. Users needed to handle large volumes of data while switching between live streams, dashboards, and queries. I used tools like Looker Studio, Tableau, and Grafana as reference points to understand data visual workflows, but ensured the final UI remained original and aligned with the product goals. The interface uses clean layouts, minimal styling, and intentional color choices with blue as the primary action color and soft neutrals as the background. Typography (Roboto) and a strong grid system helped maintain visual balance across dense sections like query builders, table schemas, and chart styling panels.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Desktop-Centered Experience</strong><br> Since this platform is used primarily by data professionals on desktops, the entire UI was designed for large-screen use. Each module from query creation to camera setup was optimized for clarity, panel separation, and efficient multitasking without overwhelming the user. The layout supports complex forms, tables, and chart previews without compromising on usability.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Impact</strong><br> Treelytics was one of the most complex projects I’ve worked on. It helped me grow as a designer especially in understanding how to translate raw technical requirements into intuitive interfaces. I learned how to manage large-scale UI systems, collaborate in real project environments, and design with real-time data in mind. The final design system laid a strong foundation for scalable future development and contributes to a more accessible, modern data analytics experience.</p>
