          <h2>Reliable Cargo</h2>
          <p>Reliable Cargo is a logistics and freight-forwarding company offering global delivery, cargo, and transport solutions. The company needed a full website that communicated its wide range of services from ocean and air transportation to warehousing and secure packaging in a way that felt professional, accessible, and globally competitive. This project was about building a clear, service-driven website from the ground up.</p>

          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 5 days</p><br>
          <p><strong>My Role</strong><br> As the UI/UX Designer for this project, I was responsible for designing the entire site for both desktop and mobile views. I collaborated with my mentor and the internal team at Careinfo Solutions to ensure the website aligned with Reliable Cargo's business goals and industry standards.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>My Contribution</strong><br> I led the UI/UX design of the entire website from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups. My responsibilities included:</p>
          <li>Designing responsive layouts for desktop and mobile</li>
          <li>Structuring content hierarchically for fast scanning and usability</li>
          <li>Creating intuitive sections like service categories, process flow, and contact forms</li>
          <li>Applying a consistent visual language through typography, icons, and color</li>
          <li>Enhancing accessibility and readability for both corporate and individual users</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Design Decision & Thought Process</strong><br> I aimed to make the brand feel established and trustworthy with a clean, corporate design that prioritizes clarity over complexity. I started by analyzing logistics websites to understand industry expectations, then created modular sections that highlight service benefits, company stats, and process steps. Iconography, color contrast, and typography were all chosen to reinforce the company's global presence and reliable delivery model. Call-to-actions were placed where they matter most near services, forms, and contact points to drive conversions without overwhelming the user.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Responsive Experience</strong><br> Since users may access shipping info on the go, I designed a fully responsive interface that adapts to all screen sizes. Content blocks restructure smoothly for mobile, with large tap targets, streamlined navigation, and reflowed text for easy reading. Forms and service sections remain interactive and functional across all devices.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Impact</strong><br> The redesigned interface successfully elevated Reliable Cargo’s digital presence, presenting the company as a trustworthy and well-established logistics provider. By focusing on structure, clarity, and service visibility, the design supports business goals such as client trust, service inquiries, and engagement. This project strengthened my ability to design for B2B service industries, with an emphasis on scalable layouts, usability, and aligning brand visuals with core business objectives.</p>
